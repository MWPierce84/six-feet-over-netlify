founders: >-
  Katie Hardy is the Founder and CEO of Six Feet Over. Katie founded the
  Detroit-based nonprofit in 2013 to serve the survivors of suicide loss in her
  community, aiming to provide financial assistance for costs associated such as
  funerals, clean up and memorials, as well as to provide outreach, awareness,
  and resources to her community. Six Feet Over, and its program Suck It!
  Suicide, are now focused on helping all survivors, with a special interest in
  the non-mainstream communities of music, art and youth demographics.


  After surviving 8 losses by suicide, beginning with the loss of her mother in 2003, Katie found that support groups and functions catered too much to the norms of society, avoiding and minimizing the needs of authenticity and honesty in the grieving process. She saw a profound need within her community for information, conversation, and postvention after loss.


  Since then, Katie has spoken at and participated in facilitating many events including Survivors’ Day conferences, school and community events, memorials, and has continued to tell her story to both public and private companies, providing a better understanding and more insight into the life of a survivor.


  Katie was recently nominated and voted in to serve on the Consumer/Survivor Subcommittee of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, and she has been featured in several articles and blogs including Hour Detroit, The Oakland Press, BLocal Detroit, and Hip In Detroit, as well as mentions in The Metro Times and discussions in the podcast A History of the Ridiculous.

We are passionate about our goals and our mission, and this is why we minimize overhead to just enough to sustain our daily operations. While we fundraise and accept donations for a variety of uses, all of which are dedicated to our mission, we allocate the vast majority of funds raised for direct financial assistance for survivors of suicide loss, helping defray and alleviate the unexpected cost burdens associated with their loss.

To accomplish our goals, we fundraise through participation in many community events, including festivals, concerts, fundraisers, memorials, and remembrances, as well as providing event sponsorships and speakers when such events align with our mission.
