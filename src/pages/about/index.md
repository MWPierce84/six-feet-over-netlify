  heading: Our Organization
  intro: We are a non-profit organization servicing the great state of Michigan.
    Our mission is to prevent suicide loss through education, advocacy, and
    support, for survivors of suicide loss, individuals with lived experience of
    suicide, and those who love and care for someone with mental health
    struggles.

We are passionate about our goals and our mission, and this is why we minimize overhead to just enough to sustain our daily operations. While we fundraise and accept donations for a variety of uses, all of which are dedicated to our mission, we allocate the vast majority of funds raised for direct financial assistance for survivors of suicide loss, helping defray and alleviate the unexpected cost burdens associated with their loss.

To accomplish our goals, we fundraise through participation in many community events, including festivals, concerts, fundraisers, memorials, and remembrances, as well as providing event sponsorships and speakers when such events align with our mission.
