### Our Vision
Six Feet Over envisions a world free of suicide loss – one where people from diverse backgrounds have access to the resources and tools they need to live peacefully and support their family and peers around issues of mental health.

### Our Goals
To make our vision a reality, Six Feet Over strategically positions itself within the community and defines 4 goals. These goals will help us create profound change at the grassroots, familial, and community levels throughout Michigan.

### Our Founder’s Story
Katie Hardy is the Founder and CEO of Six Feet Over. Katie founded the Detroit-based nonprofit in 2013 to serve the survivors of suicide loss in her community, aiming to provide financial assistance for costs associated such as funerals, clean up and memorials, as well as to provide outreach, awareness, and resources to her community. Six Feet Over, and its program Suck It! Suicide, are now focused on helping all survivors, with a special interest in the non-mainstream communities of music, art and youth demographics.

After surviving 8 losses by suicide, beginning with the loss of her mother in 2003, Katie found that support groups and functions catered too much to the norms of society, avoiding and minimizing the needs of authenticity and honesty in the grieving process. She saw a profound need within her community for information, conversation, and postvention after loss.

Since then, Katie has spoken at and participated in facilitating many events including Survivors’ Day conferences, school and community events, memorials, and has continued to tell her story to both public and private companies, providing a better understanding and more insight into the life of a survivor.

Katie was recently nominated and voted in to serve on the Consumer/Survivor Subcommittee of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, and she has been featured in several articles and blogs including Hour Detroit, The Oakland Press, BLocal Detroit, and Hip In Detroit, as well as mentions in The Metro Times and discussions in the podcast A History of the Ridiculous.
