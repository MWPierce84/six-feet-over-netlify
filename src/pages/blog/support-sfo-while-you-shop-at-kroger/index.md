Six Feet Over recently partnered with Kroger Community Rewards, a program that donates to non-profit organizations. All you have to do is enroll in Community Rewards, select Six Feet Over as your preferred organization, and voilà! Kroger will automatically donate to Six Feet Over every time you shop.

Here's a handy guide on how to get setup:

2. Once you're signed in, click the My Account drop down under your name and go to My Account.![](images/stepfour.png)

4. Under Find An Organization, search for Six Feet Over. Then, simply click the Enroll button under the SFO search result.![](images/stepeight.png)
5. You're all set! Just use your Kroger Plus Card or enter your Alternate ID when you shop. The amount Kroger donates to us depends on how many folks enroll, so please enroll and share with your friends and family who shop at Kroger.
